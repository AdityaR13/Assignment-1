Managing employee retention
Using R, read the data into a data frame called store

Three very important variables in this analysis are the store Profit, the management tenure (MTenure) and the crew tenure (CTenure) 
 
Use R to measure the mean and standard deviation of Profit.
Use R to measure the mean and standard deviation of MTenure.
Use R to measure the mean and standard deviation of CTenure.

Use R to print the {StoreID, Sales, Profit, MTenure, CTenure} of the top 10 most profitable stores
Use R to print the {StoreID, Sales, Profit, MTenure, CTenure} of the bottom 10 least profitable store

Use R to draw a scatter plot of Profit vs. MTenure.
Use R to draw a scatter plot of Profit vs. CTenure.
 

Use R to measure the correlation between Profit and MTenure
Use R to measure the correlation between Profit and CTenure
 

Use R to construct the following Corrgram based on all variables in the dataset

Run a Pearson's Correlation test on the correlation between Profit and MTenure. What is the p-value?
Run a Pearson's Correlation test on the correlation between Profit and CTenure. What is the p-value?


List the explanatory variable(s) whose beta-coefficients are statistically significant (p < 0.05)
List the explanatory variable(s) whose beta-coefficients are not statistically significant (p > 0.05)


What is expected change in the Profit at a store, if the Manager's tenure i.e. number of months of experience with Store24, increases by one month?
What is expected change in the Profit at a store, if the Crew's tenure i.e. number of months of experience with Store24, increases by one month?
